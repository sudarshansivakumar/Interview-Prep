# Interview-Prep
This repository contains a list of questions that I will solve related to data structures and algorithms for interviews in technical companies. 
Most of the questions are in LeetCode ( will be adding the links to the questions as well). Some of the topics covered so far include:
  * Dyanmic Programming
  * Graph Algorithms 
  * Linked Lists and Trees
